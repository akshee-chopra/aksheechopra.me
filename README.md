The main home page of my website is index.html. It's a welcome/intro page where you can find links to the two main sections of my website (code gallery and about). 

I used ac.css to format the index.html file. 

For my code gallery page, I used code.html. This has a scrolling feature that takes you through 4 slides. In the slides I describe some code projects/programs that I have done that have been meaningful/enjoyable to me! I used a "carousel" feature for the scrolling. 

I formatted code.html using ab.css. 

I coded my about page on about.html. For my about page, I have four different cards to click on. Here, the cards have different information associated with them (a picture of me, where I'm from, an interesting fact about me, and a small bio about me). When you hover over the cards, they'll "light up." When you actually click on them, they'll take you to a subpage of my about page which "reveals" the information of the card you clicked on. The subpages of about.html are where.html, fact.html, more_info.html, and pic.html. These all follow the relatively same structure as about.html. The only difference is that the card image that was clicked on is replaced with text, which reveals the answer to the card. 

I formatted about.html (and all the subpages associated with it) using ab.css as well. 

I also have an images folder here which I used to add all my images to my website in addition to my favicon and pumpkin cursor (which activates on buttons)!
